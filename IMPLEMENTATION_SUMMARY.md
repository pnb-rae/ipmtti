## 🚀 How It Works

### When a User Submits a Form:

1. **Form Submission** → Frontend sends data to `/api/sendMessage`
2. **PDF Generation** → Creates professional PDF with form data
3. **Parallel Execution** → Three actions run simultaneously:
   - 📧 **Email** → HTML email + PDF attachment to `international.machinery.inst@gmail.com`
   - 📱 **WhatsApp Text** → Summary message to `+254715016300`
   - 📄 **WhatsApp Document** → PDF attachment via WhatsApp
4. **User Feedback** → Success message: "✅ Your message has been sent via Email and WhatsApp!"
