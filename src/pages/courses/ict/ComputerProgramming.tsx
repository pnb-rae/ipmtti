    overview: "The Computer Programming course introduces learners to software development and coding fundamentals. Students learn programming logic, algorithms, and data structures using languages such as Python, Java, or C++. The program covers variables, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, and database connectivity. Learners develop practical applications including desktop programs, simple games, and business software while understanding software development lifecycle and debugging techniques. The course emphasizes problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and systematic approach to building software solutions. Students work on individual and group projects, building a portfolio of applications. This training prepares graduates for junior programmer positions, software testing roles, or further studies in computer science and software engineering, tapping into the growing tech industry opportunities in Kenya and globally.",
